            Muslin Brand realizes the importance of a strong fraud detection and
            resolution capability. We and our online payments partners monitor
            transactions continuously for suspicious activity and flag
            potentially fraudulent transactions for manual verification by our
            team. <br /> <br /> In the rarest of rare cases, when our team is
            unable to rule out the possibility of fraud categorically, the
            transaction is kept on hold, and the customer is requested to
            provide identity documents. The ID documents help us ensure that the
            purchases were indeed made by a genuine card holder. We apologize
            for any inconvenience that may be caused to customers and request
            them to bear with us in the larger interest of ensuring a safe and
            secure environment for online transactions.
